# WeatherApp

Have a look at my small WeatherApp with hardcoded location, so it's definitly pretty useful ... not :) Anyway it was a nice testing playground for Alamofire and parsing JSON data. Many many thanks to <a href="https://www.epicpxls.com/items/weather-app-ui">EpicPxls</a> for the nice artwork and to <a href="http://openweathermap.org">OpenWeatherMap</a> for weather data.
